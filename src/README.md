Based on the requirements, we will need the following core classes, functions, and methods:

Frontend (React):
1. App.js: This is the main component of our React application. It will contain the SearchBar and Chat components.
2. SearchBar.js: This component will handle the input from the user and pass it to the Flask backend.
3. Chat.js: This component will display the conversation between the user and the AI.
4. Loading.js: This component will display a loading animation while the Flask backend is processing the request.

Backend (Flask):
1. app.py: This is the main file of our Flask application. It will handle the POST request from the frontend and make the necessary API call to OpenAI.
2. openai_api.py: This file will contain the function that makes the API call to OpenAI.

CSS:
1. App.css: This file will contain the styles for the App component.
2. SearchBar.css: This file will contain the styles for the SearchBar component.
3. Chat.css: This file will contain the styles for the Chat component.
4. Loading.css: This file will contain the styles for the Loading component.

Let's start with the entrypoint file for the frontend, which is usually index.js in a React application.
